# Task 1 - An Analysis of Porejimo Supply Chain Disruptions
## Jeff Wagg (February 22, 2024)

## Background

The Republic of Porejimo faces significant challenges with the diversion of humanitarian supplies, which hinders the provision of timely and quality aid to vulnerable populations. Diversions can relate to different sections of the supply chain for bringing humanitarian supplies to intended aid recipients. One of the key reasons known for the diversions is the loss of stock due to a growing black market for the packaging materials the aid materials are transported in.

Recently, there has been a notable increase in the prices for specialized packaging materials. This has raised concerns that inventories are being diverted from loading warehouses before getting to the distribution points to be sold in the black market where they attract high prices.

The Country Office of the Republic of Porejimo would like to use this data to make a prudent decision about a potential intervention to address the issue. They would like your data science expertise to help address the following questions:

- Are the market prices for the packaging materials explaining the diversion of humanitarian supplies?

- What other factors might be explaining the diversion of humanitarian supplies?

- What else should the Country Office think about to understand the situation (for example, any reason to suspect the data quality)?
